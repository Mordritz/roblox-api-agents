# Agents.json specification for Roblox Open Cloud APIs

I'm using this project to write and test an [agents.json](https://github.com/wild-card-ai/agents-json) definition for Roblox's Open Cloud APIs.
This would allow developers to build applications with LLM agents that can directly query or make changes to Roblox resources, for example a chatbot that can quickly
tell you what items a player holds in their inventory, or a chatbot that can manage your Roblox group membership applications, etc.

## Status

Currently, only a very limited subset of Roblox API calls are supported.
